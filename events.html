            <h2>The Siege of Leningrad</h2>
            <p>The siege of Leningrad was a prolonged military blockade undertaken by the Axis powers against the Soviet
                city of Leningrad (present-day Saint Petersburg) on the Eastern Front of World War II. Germany's Army
                Group North advanced from the south, while the German-allied Finnish army invaded from the north and
                completed the ring around the city.</p>

            <h2>Battle of Stalingrad</h2>
            <p>The Battle of Stalingrad (23 August 1942 2 February 1943) was a major battle on the Eastern
                Front of World War II where Nazi Germany and its allies unsuccessfully fought the Soviet Union for
                control of the city of Stalingrad (later renamed Volgograd) in Southern Russia. The battle was marked by
                fierce close-quarters combat and direct assaults on civilians in air raids, with the battle epitomizing
                urban warfare.</p>

            <h2>Battle of Berlin</h2>
            <p>
                Battle of Berlin, one of the final battles of World War II. It took place from April 20 to May 2, 1945,
                and it ended with the fall of Berlin to the Soviet Red Army, which took revenge for the suffering of the
                Soviet people since 1941. The Battle of Berlin resulted in the surrender of the German army and the
                death of Adolf Hitler. It was a resounding victory for the Soviet Union and the Allies.
