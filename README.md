# Watching the Numbers

I created this website to teach and inform people interested in history. Specifically people interested in WW2 history. The site is based around the casualties of WW2. With world conflicts seemingly on the rise recently, I thought it best to remind people of the consequences of war. 

Watching the Numbers is made up of the following sections:

1. Home
2. Tragic Events
3. Sources
4. Register

Site owner's goals:

1. To teach those interested in history about the consequences of war.
2. Inspire users to learn about current conflicts affecting people in the world today.
3. To get users to register to recieve more information surrounding WW2.
4. To inform users about lesser known tragedies during ww2.
5. To provide reliable and unbiased sources supporting my statements.

User goals:

1. As a first-time visitor, I want to easily find information about the casualties of WW2.
2. As a first-time visitor, I want to learn about lesser known aspects of the war.
3. As a first-time visitor, I would like to be able to register. To recieve more information to my email.
4. As a recurring or first-time visitor, I would like to easily find sources to do my own research.
5. As a recurring or first-time visitor, I would like to find clear and concise graphs on ww2 casualties.



# UX / UI

## Strategy 

After thinking about the strategy for my site, I came up with a target audience for my site. This also inckuded what features they would need from the site.

### Target users:

1. 18 - 50 years old
2. New / Seasoned people interested in history.
3. People looking for unbiased sources on WW2 casualties.
4. People who are interested in WW2.
5. People interested in data surrounding WW2.

### What the user would look for:

* Easy to understand and visually appealing graphs displaying data.
* A simple and clean site that is easy to traverse.
* A site they can register on to recieve more information on WW2.
* Learn something new about a subject that they may know a lot about.

I wanted to keep the website as visually clean as possible. The numbers that needed to be included inside the graph
were quite large. I did not want to take away from them by overloading the screen with other information. WIth the 
site having a simple layout, this really helped make it responsive for mobile and tablets.

## Scope

To help the user achieve their desired experience, these features were included:

* A clean header and nav bar to navgiate the website.
* A sources page to allow the users to access unbiased information.
* A register page for users to sign up for more information.
* Two graphs showing the casualties of the Asian and European theatre.
* A tragic events page to shed light on costly events during the war.
* Social media links in the footer to lead to social media pages.
* A link to return to the top of the page, as not to stop the users journey.
* A clear introduction to the site to explain its purpose.
* A response page informing the user they are registered.

## Structure

This is a multi page layout, this was chosen as not to overload the user with too much information on one page. The nav bar allows the user to navigate the site to the information that they are interested in. An arrow is provided at the bottom of each page, so the user can continue their journey through the information provided. The home page provides two graphs showing the European and Asian theatres of war. I wanted to separate the two because each deserved their own graphs. The Tragic Events page was to then dive deeper into some of the more costly scenarios in WW2. 

The sites goal was meant to give an overview of the wars cost and not to get to bogged down in specific details of it all. The home page would give the user an overview, which would then lead them to more specific scenarios in the tragic events page. Lastly if the user wanted to recieve more information they could register in the register page. As well as make use of the sources page to do some digging of their own.
